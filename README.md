# Final_Project_Customer_LTV_Prediction_Model
This is a dataset taken from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sahideseker/customer-lifetime-value-prediction-dataset). This synthetic dataset contains customer purchase data used to estimate Customer Lifetime Value (CLV). It includes variables such as purchase history, total spending, and customer tenure. Useful for building predictive models in marketing and business analytics. The dataset is used to predict CLV using regression models, perform customer segmentation and practice marketing analytics and LTV estimation. I had performed XgBoost and Random Forest and found that Random Forest performed well on the training data with a low MAE value. The predicted values have fitted well with the actual data.
